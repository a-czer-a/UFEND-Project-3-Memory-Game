## **Description**

This project of a memory game app was accomplished as a part of Udacity Front-End Nanodegree and uses HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. 

## **How to play**

### **Game features and rules**
- The player flips one card over to reveal underlying flag icon and then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same flag. 
- Two flipped cards are considered as one move.
- If cards don’t match, they are flipped face down; if they match, flags remain visible and the name of the country is being displayed in the speech bubble on the right.
- Score panel displays the number of moves, time and rating. The score is presented in the form of full and empty stars and depends on the number of moves the player had taken to match all flags. 
- Timer starts when the first card is flipped.
- „New game” button allows restarting the game.
- The player wins when all 8 flags are correctly matched. Game is finished then and popup with the summary (containing rating and time) appears. 
- The player gets the chance to play once again by clicking „Play again” button added to the popup.

### **Issues**

The game is not yet ready to be played in the horizontal orientation.
